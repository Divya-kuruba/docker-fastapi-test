docker-fastapi-test is a simple fastapi web application
This apllication is dockerized and run using docker compose file which is written in yaml.
After running it successfully using docker compose ,this application is deployed using jenkins pipeline on server.
I have configured this jenkins pipeline using Prometheus and Grafana monitoring tools.
Below attached screenshots of monitoring tools.
